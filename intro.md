## What is a prompt 

A prompt is a question asked to an AI

## What is prompt engineering

In a prompt you can give multiple advices to the AI

First, a **role** to the AI by telling him for example 

*You are an expert in writing viral Youtube titles*

Second, some details about how it will generate the answers

*Think of catching the attention of the watchers*

Third, let him ask questions for example by telling him

*If you have any question about the video, ask before you try to generate the titles. Ok?*

After that the AI will start to ask questions on what we are searching

This is called engineering

So prompt engineering is the ability to mix all this and submit it to an AI to have answers

# What are the diffrent kind of prompts
