# How to write prompts

When you start writing prompts on ChatGPT, you come from a long journey using Google or another search engine, so you may ask it "What is javascript" so it will generate an answer in the form of a text explaining the basic concepts of JS

Now with this technology things are a bit more interesting, you can do prompt engineering by giving ChatGPT a context, tasks, and iterate on the answers to develop the ideas it gives you

## Context is important

Contextual relevance is crucial for generating coherent and accurate responses from ChatGPT

Providing enugh context helps to guide ChatGPT and improves the quality of the generated content

Without enough context, ChatGPT may generate a response that is off-topic, irrelevant, or incnonsistent with the goal of the prompt

It is crucial to consider contextual relavance when designing prompts

### Example 

"Generate a list of interview questions for a Software Engeineer job in a tech start-up with fast-paced culture for an entry-level position." Break down the prompt above into Contextual relevance

After that run your prompt to see the result

## Setting a task for ChatGPT

Task definition sets the specific goal or objective for ChatGPT to achieve

Clear understanding of the task is crucial for designing an effective prompt

Task definition should be specific, concise, and avoid ambiguity or vagueness

The task definition should align with ChatGPT capabilities

A clear task definition helps ChatGPT better understand what it's supposed to do and improve the quality of the generated content

Task definition is crucial factor to consider when designing prompts

### Example

"Write a romantic comedy screenplay. The main character must be in their 20s and the story must take place in a small town. The main plot should revolve around the two main characters overcoming obstacles to their relationship, while humourus situations complicate the story. The screenplay should include at least two songs" Break down the prompt into Task Definitions:

After that run your prompt to see the result

## Specificity

Specificity referes to the level of details and precision in a prompt

The more specific a prompt is, the more likely it is that ChatGPT will generate a targeted and accurate response

To achieve specificity in a prompt, important details such as the type of journey or question, the starting and ending points, characters involved, and any relevant background information should be specific

Vague or general prompts can lead to off-topic, irrelevent, or inconsistent responses from ChatGPT

Specificity is crucial in designing prompts as it imp^roves the quality and relevance of the generated content

### Example

"Write a story about a character who embarks on a quest to find a lost magical artifact. Describe the journey they take, the obstacles they face, and how they eventually find the relic. Be sure to include elements of adventure, suspence, and danger, as well as details about the characters and the mystical creatures they may encounter along the way" Break down the prompt analyse the specificity of the prompts:

After that run your prompt to see the result

## Iterations

Iteration is a crucial part of the prompt design process

Prompt design is an iterative process and may take multiple attempts to create an effective prompt

Iteration involves refining and improving the prompt through cycles of design, testing, and evaluation

Each iteration should be guided by the results of the previous trials, aiming to address any limitations encountered

Embracing an iterative approach allows for continuous improvement and optimisation of the generated content

Iteration is important to consider when designing promps to create effetive, efficient, and outcome-aligned prompt

## How to design a prompt with these 4 factors in mind

Generate a 300-word article for a personal developement website that provides a comprehensive guide to increasing productivity. The article should cover various strategies and techniques, and be written in a clear and concise style accessible to a general audience. To support your advice, utilize research and expert opinions from credible sources like academic journals and productivity experts. Incorporate relevant statistics, examples, and case studies to illustrate your points and bring the advice to life. Considere the potential challenges and obstacles in increasing productivity, and offer strategies to overcome them

### Context

The prompt is for personal developement website that is providing advice on how to increase productivity

### Task definition

Generate a 300-word article that provides a comprehensive guide to increasing productivity

The article should cover a range of strategies and techniques, and should be written in a clear and concise style that is accessible to the general audience

### Specificity

Use search and expert opinions from credible sources, such as academic journals and productivity experts, to support your audience. Incorporate relevant statistics, examples, and case studies to illustrate your points and help bring the advice to life. Also, make sure to consider the potential challenges and obstacles to increasing productivity, provide strategies to overcome them

### Iteration guidance

In the first iteration, run this : focus on the importance of setting clear goals and prioritizing tasks. Discuss the benefits of goal settings, and provide practivcal tips for setting and achieving goals

In the second iteration, analyse the benefits of the time management techniques, such as the pomodoro method and calendat blocking. Provide practical tips for implementing thses techniques, and discuss how they can help increase productivity

Tape : write a h2 headline for the passage:

In the third iteration, discuss the role of technology in increasing productivity. Consider both the benefits and drawcacks of using technology, and provide advice on how to efficiently use technology to boost productivity

In the final iteration summarize the key takeways from the article and provide a comprehensive guide to increasing productivity. Make sure to provide a clear conclusion and actionable tips for readers based on your findings
