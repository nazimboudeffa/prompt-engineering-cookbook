What is a prompt 

A prompt is a question asked to an AI

Two types of prompts

* Prompt by exemple
* Direct prompting

In a prompt you can give multiple advices to the AI

First, a **role** to the AI by telling him for example 

*You are an expert in writing viral Youtube titles*


Second, some details about how it will generate the answers

*Think of catching the attention of the watchers*

Third, let him ask questions for example by telling him

*If you have any question about the video, ask before you try to generate the titles. Ok?*

After that the AI will start to ask questions on what we are searching

This is called engineering
